## Problem 
In todayâ€™s era where an average individual who uses a mobile phone, receives hundreds of 
mobile SMS every day. Some of them are useful to him/her, most of them are not. Some messages 
are spam containing a possible virus and could prove to be fatal for any device. Every message we 
receive on our phone gives us a notification or an alert and this could prove to very irritating for the 
user if the notification was about something not important or relevant to him. So there needs to a 
system that does all the classification and only displays the messages that the relevant to the user 
based on his/her feedback and also does spam filtering for him/her. 
Most of the systems which exist requires additional computing power to determine whether a message 
is spam or not, so there is a need for a system which does this classification in real time after getting 
trained on a dataset. The System should be able to perform real-time classification and filtering of text 
messages.

## Solution 
Here we are providing the user an android application that will classify the Text message, notification 
and even the messages from other messaging platforms into various categories like Primary, updates, 
promotional, OTP, banking transactions, etc. using Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Networks.
